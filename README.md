## Description

**Campus Cart** is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of finding and ordering food and products on campus.

By enhancing the way vendors and buyers communicate and transact, the app aims to eliminate the chaos of WhatsApp group promotions. This organization will not only increase sales for campus vendors but also offer greater convenience and accessibility for students and faculty, fostering a more vibrant campus marketplace.
