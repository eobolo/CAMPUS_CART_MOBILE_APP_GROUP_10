**Campus Cart Mobile App**

Campus Cart is designed to organize and simplify campus shopping by providing a platform for vendors to list products and services, while students and faculty can easily browse, order, and connect with vendors. Initially focused on food vendors, the app will expand to include categories like clothing and services, making it the go-to hub for all campus shopping needs. By reducing clutter in social and academic platforms (like WhatsApp), Campus Cart streamlines the experience for both vendors and buyers.
